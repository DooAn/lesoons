            <h1>Apollo 11 Mission Overview</h1>
            <p>Mission Objective
            The primary objective of Apollo 11 was to complete a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961:
            perform a crewed lunar landing and return to Earth.
            
            Additional flight objectives included scientific exploration by the lunar module, or LM, crew; deployment of a
            television camera to transmit signals to Earth; and deployment of a solar wind composition experiment, seismic
            experiment package and a Laser Ranging Retroreflector. During the exploration, the two astronauts were to gather samples
            of lunar-surface materials for return to Earth. They also were to extensively photograph the lunar terrain, the deployed
            scientific equipment, the LM spacecraft, and each other, both with still and motion picture cameras. This was to be the
            last Apollo mission to fly a "free-return" trajectory, which would enable a return to Earth with no engine firing,
            providing a ready abort of the mission at any time prior to lunar orbit insertion.</p>

            <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
            <p class="green">Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, carrying Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael
            Collins and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin into an initial Earth-orbit of 114 by 116 miles. An estimated 650
            million people watched Armstrong's televised image and heard his voice describe the event as he took "...one small step
            for a man, one giant leap for mankind" on July 20, 1969.</p>
            <p class="grey">Two hours, 44 minutes and one-and-a-half revolutions after launch, the S-IVB stage reignited for a second burn of five
            minutes, 48 seconds, placing Apollo 11 into a translunar orbit. The command and service module, or CSM, Columbia
            separated from the stage, which included the spacecraft-lunar module adapter, or SLA, containing the lunar module, or
            LM, Eagle. After transposition and jettisoning of the SLA panels on the S-IVB stage, the CSM docked with the LM. The
            S-IVB stage separated and injected into heliocentric orbit four hours, 40 minutes into the flight.</p>

            <p class="yellow">
            On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin entered the LM again, made a final check, and at 100 hours, 12 minutes into the flight,
            the Eagle undocked and separated from Columbia for visual inspection. At 101 hours, 36 minutes, when the LM was behind
            the moon on its 13th orbit, the LM descent engine fired for 30 seconds to provide retrograde thrust and commence descent
            orbit insertion, changing to an orbit of 9 by 67 miles, on a trajectory that was virtually identical to that flown by
            Apollo 10. At 102 hours, 33 minutes, after Columbia and Eagle had reappeared from behind the moon and when the LM was
            about 300 miles uprange, powered descent initiation was performed with the descent engine firing for 756.3 seconds.
            After eight minutes, the LM was at "high gate" about 26,000 feet above the surface and about five miles from the landing
            site.
            </p>
            <p>The descent engine continued to provide braking thrust until about 102 hours, 45 minutes into the mission. Partially
            piloted manually by Armstrong, the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility in Site 2 at 0 degrees, 41 minutes, 15 seconds
            north latitude and 23 degrees, 26 minutes east longitude. This was about four miles downrange from the predicted
            touchdown point and occurred almost one-and-a-half minutes earlier than scheduled. It included a powered descent that
            ran a mere nominal 40 seconds longer than preflight planning due to translation maneuvers to avoid a crater during the
            final phase of landing. Attached to the descent stage was a commemorative plaque signed by President Richard M. Nixon
            and the three astronauts.</p>
